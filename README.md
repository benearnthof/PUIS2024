# PUIS2024
Production Ready Implementation of PUIS with Custom STEGO backbones.

This repository consists of two parts: A STEGO directory that contains everything needed to pretrain custom STEGO models with DINOv2 backbones, and a PUIS directory that utilizes these pretrained STEGO models to train an SNGP segmentation head to perform probabilistic unsupervised image segmentation.
